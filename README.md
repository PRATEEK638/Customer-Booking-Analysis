Project Title: Customer Booking Analysis

Overview:
This project involves a comprehensive exploration of a flight booking dataset containing 50,000 records of customer reservations. The primary goal is to extract actionable insights—such as booking trends, channel performance, trip‐type distribution, and factors influencing booking success—and to present these insights through both programmatic summaries and a polished, automated PowerPoint report.

1. Data Loading & Encoding Handling
Robust CSV Import:

A custom function (load_csv_with_fallback) attempts to read “customer_booking.csv” using several common encodings (UTF-8, Latin-1, ISO-8859-1, CP1252, UTF-16).

If all standard encodings fail, the code falls back to a “replace‐invalid‐character” mode to ensure no data is lost due to encoding mismatches.

Success Check:

If loading succeeds, the script reports the total number of rows loaded and displays the first two rows for verification.

If loading fails entirely, an empty DataFrame is created so that subsequent code still runs safely (without crashing).

2. Data Verification & Initial Exploration
Empty‐Frame Warning:

If the DataFrame ends up empty (e.g., file not found or completely corrupted), an on‐screen warning suggests possible next steps: reuploading the CSV or checking file location.

Basic Data Quality Checks (when data is present):

Numeric Columns Summary:
A descriptive statistics summary (.describe()) is generated for all numeric columns, including count, mean, standard deviation, min/max values, and quartiles.

Categorical Value Counts:
For up to the first three text columns, the code prints the top three most frequent categories (value counts). This immediately highlights dominant labels (e.g., channels, trip types).

Date Conversion & Visualization Preparation:
If a column named booking_date exists, it is converted to a datetime object. Then, a new column month is extracted to allow plotting “Bookings by Month” in a bar chart—revealing seasonal or monthly trends.

3. Cleaning & Saving a “Cleaned” Dataset
Exporting Cleaned Data:

Once the initial checks and transformations succeed, the resulting DataFrame (with parsed dates, potential dropped duplicates/nulls, etc.) is saved to a new file named cleaned_data.csv.

In a Colab environment, the script automatically triggers a download so the user can obtain the cleaned dataset locally.

4. Automated PowerPoint Report Generation
Using the python-pptx library (installed at runtime), the project dynamically creates an 8-slide PowerPoint deck summarizing key findings. The process is as follows:

Slide 1: Title Slide

Title: “Customer Booking Analysis”

Subtitle: “Insights from 50,000 Flight Bookings | Task 2 Report”

Slide 2: Methodology

Lists core steps:

✓ Data Source: 50,000 anonymized bookings.

✓ Variables: sales_channel, trip_type, booking_complete, and more.

✓ Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling nulls, encoding fallbacks.

✓ Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, python-pptx).

Slide 3: Key Metrics

Highlights major summary statistics (pulled, for instance, from earlier descriptive analysis):

Total Bookings: 50,000

Booking Success Rate: 14.96 % (or rounded to 15 %)

Average Passengers per Booking: 1.59

Top Booking Channel: Internet (88.8 %)

Slide 4: Booking Channels (Visualization)

Pie Chart: Shows proportion of bookings made via Internet vs. Mobile (88.8 % Internet, 11.2 % Mobile).

Bullet Text: Emphasizes that the majority of users book through the website—indicating where UX improvements can have the highest impact.

Slide 5: Trip Type Distribution

Table or Bar Chart: Breaks down bookings by trip_type:

RoundTrip: 49,497 (∼99 %)

OneWay: 387 (∼0.78 %)

CircleTrip: 116 (∼0.23 %)

Insight Text: “Opportunity to promote OneWay/CircleTrip packages” since RoundTrips dominate.

Slide 6: Booking Success Drivers

Correlation Table: Displays correlation coefficients among booking_complete, purchase_lead (lead time before travel), and flight_duration.

Insight: Shorter purchase lead times (days between booking and departure) tend to correlate with higher booking success—informing marketing or reminder campaigns.

Slide 7: Strategic Recommendations

Four concise, action-oriented bullet points (each optionally with an icon):

Enhance web platform (because 88.8 % of bookings come via Internet).

Create RoundTrip bundles (e.g., meals, seat upgrades) to drive up‐sell.

Target last-minute bookers with optimized messaging (average lead time ≈ 85 days).

A/B test mobile app promotions to grow Mobile share.

Slide 8: Q&A / Thank You

Simple “Thank You” slide inviting questions, closing the presentation.

After constructing all slides, the script saves the file (e.g., Customer_Booking_Analysis_Task2_Final.pptx) to disk and triggers a download in Colab, allowing the user to retrieve a fully formatted PowerPoint.

5. Key Technical Components & Highlights
Encoding-Resilient CSV Import:

By iterating through multiple encodings and falling back to error-replacement mode, the code ensures robust reading of real-world CSV data, which can contain mixed or non-standard encodings.

Safe Execution Guards:

Conditional checks (if df.empty) prevent subsequent analysis from failing if data is missing; helpful prompts guide the user toward resolving issues.

Automated Chart Creation:

Matplotlib is used to create pie and bar charts, which are saved to an in-memory BytesIO buffer (PNG format) and then injected into PowerPoint slides.

Dynamic Table Insertion:

The trip-type distribution is presented as an actual table within a slide, with header row styling (colored background) and data rows populated programmatically.

End-to-End Workflow:

The script covers everything from reading raw CSV → basic exploratory data analysis → visualization generation → polished presentation creation → final download. This makes it easy to rerun whenever new booking data arrives.

6. Potential Extensions & Next Steps
Deeper Statistical Modeling:

Incorporate logistic regression to predict booking completion (using lead time, channel, trip type, etc.).

Time-series forecasting of monthly booking volume to anticipate demand spikes.

User Segmentation:

Cluster customers by booking patterns (e.g., high-frequency vs. occasional travelers) to tailor marketing efforts.

Interactive Dashboard Version:

Build a Streamlit or Dash app for real-time filtering by region, date range, or customer demographics.

Additional Data Enrichment:

Merge with external data: airport codes, fare classes, holiday calendars, or competitor pricing, to study pricing elasticity.

Automated Scheduling:

Deploy this script on a scheduler (e.g., Cron or Airflow) so that each month’s new booking data automatically triggers a refreshed PowerPoint sent to stakeholders.

Summary:
This Data Analysis project systematically ingests a large flight-booking dataset, performs sanity checks and descriptive analytics, visualizes core trends (channels, trip types, booking success), and culminates in a self-generating PowerPoint deck. The combined use of Pandas, Matplotlib, and python-pptx makes it an end-to-end, reproducible workflow—ideal for periodic reporting to product managers, marketing teams, or executive stakeholders.
